# Glossary
## Data Warehouse
Hierarchical DW - stores data in files or folders. Uses proprietary systems.
## DataLake (Databrics propertary)
Repositories for raw data in a variety of formats (structured, unstructuured, from audio, video, xml, csv, avro, parquet, compressed, chunked, from bytes to GBs). It is represented mostly as a storage but sometimes as an architecture (Kappa, Lambda, Delta) with processing segments (ETL or sometimes ELT) pipelines in place.
Uses object storage, flat locations, tags, metadata, unique ID for performance improvements. Schema on read. Unstructured data support - good for ML. .
Examples: HDFS, GCS, S3
Pros:
- Uses cheap storage, open formats
- Highly durable, low costs, scalable
- ML friendly
Cons:
- Don't support transactions 
- No data check, quality, consistency
Good for:
- Powering data science and machine learning
- Centralization, consolidation, cataloging data

# Data pipeline
## Analogy to water pipelines
Fetching data from lakes, rivers and ponds could take long distances and time. It was manual process but in time the demand was bigger and the water supply has been automated with the new technologies.
Basics
Data pipeline is a mechanism to transfer data from point A to point B through some intermediate points C,D and E where data processing takes place.
Data pipeline receives data from the Data Producers and the result of the processing is used by the Data Consumers.

# Normalisation

### **Database Normal Forms**
Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. Normal forms are a series of rules applied to database tables to ensure consistency and efficiency.

---

### **1st Normal Form (1NF): Eliminate Repeating Groups**
**Principle**: Each column should hold atomic (indivisible) values, and there should be no repeating groups or arrays within a table. Each row must be unique.

- **Good Example**:
  | OrderID | Product    | Quantity |
  |---------|------------|----------|
  | 1       | Apple      | 10       |
  | 1       | Banana     | 5        |
  | 2       | Orange     | 3        |

- **Bad Example** (Repeating groups):
  | OrderID | Product1 | Quantity1 | Product2 | Quantity2 |
  |---------|----------|-----------|----------|-----------|
  | 1       | Apple    | 10        | Banana   | 5         |

**Issue**: Difficult to query and maintain as the number of products grows.

---

### **2nd Normal Form (2NF): Eliminate Partial Dependencies**
**Principle**: Ensure that every non-key column is fully dependent on the whole primary key (for composite keys). Tables with a single-column primary key are automatically in 2NF if they meet 1NF.

- **Good Example**:
  **Orders Table**:
  | OrderID | CustomerID |
  |---------|------------|
  | 1       | 101        |
  | 2       | 102        |

  **OrderDetails Table**:
  | OrderID | ProductID | Quantity |
  |---------|-----------|----------|
  | 1       | 201       | 10       |
  | 1       | 202       | 5        |

- **Bad Example**:
  | OrderID | CustomerID | ProductID | Quantity |
  |---------|------------|-----------|----------|
  | 1       | 101        | 201       | 10       |
  | 1       | 101        | 202       | 5        |

**Issue**: "CustomerID" depends only on `OrderID`, not the combination of `OrderID` and `ProductID`. This creates redundancy.

---

### **3rd Normal Form (3NF): Eliminate Transitive Dependencies**
**Principle**: Ensure that non-key columns are only dependent on the primary key, not on other non-key columns.

- **Good Example**:
  **Orders Table**:
  | OrderID | CustomerID | OrderDate |
  |---------|------------|-----------|
  | 1       | 101        | 2024-11-25|

  **Customers Table**:
  | CustomerID | CustomerName |
  |------------|--------------|
  | 101        | John Doe     |

- **Bad Example**:
  | OrderID | CustomerID | CustomerName |
  |---------|------------|--------------|
  | 1       | 101        | John Doe     |
  | 2       | 101        | John Doe     |

**Issue**: "CustomerName" depends on `CustomerID`, not directly on `OrderID`, leading to redundancy and maintenance problems.

---

### **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF): Generalization of 3NF**
**Principle**: Every determinant (column or combination of columns that uniquely identify another column) must be a candidate key.

- **Good Example**:
  **Rooms Table**:
  | RoomID | RoomType | PricePerNight |
  |--------|----------|---------------|
  | 101    | Single   | 100           |
  | 102    | Double   | 150           |

- **Bad Example**:
  | RoomID | RoomType | Manager       |
  |--------|----------|---------------|
  | 101    | Single   | Alice         |
  | 102    | Double   | Bob           |

**Issue**: "RoomType" determines "Manager," but "RoomType" is not a candidate key (itâ€™s not unique).

---

### **4th Normal Form (4NF): Eliminate Multi-Valued Dependencies**
**Principle**: A table should not have more than one multi-valued dependency. Multi-valued dependencies occur when one column can have multiple values independently of another.

- **Good Example**:
  **Courses Table**:
  | StudentID | CourseID |
  |-----------|----------|
  | 1         | Math     |
  | 1         | Science  |
  | 2         | Math     |

  **Hobbies Table**:
  | StudentID | Hobby    |
  |-----------|----------|
  | 1         | Painting |
  | 1         | Chess    |
  | 2         | Swimming |

- **Bad Example**:
  | StudentID | CourseID | Hobby      |
  |-----------|----------|------------|
  | 1         | Math     | Painting   |
  | 1         | Science  | Chess      |

**Issue**: Independent multi-valued facts (Courses and Hobbies) are combined, leading to redundancy.

---

### **5th Normal Form (5NF): Eliminate Join Dependencies**
**Principle**: A table is in 5NF if it cannot be decomposed into smaller tables without losing data.

- **Good Example**:
  **Suppliers Table**:
  | SupplierID | PartID |
  |------------|--------|
  | 1          | A      |
  | 1          | B      |
  | 2          | A      |

  **Projects Table**:
  | ProjectID | PartID |
  |-----------|--------|
  | X         | A      |
  | X         | B      |
  | Y         | A      |

- **Bad Example**:
  | SupplierID | PartID | ProjectID |
  |------------|--------|-----------|
  | 1          | A      | X         |
  | 1          | B      | X         |
  | 2          | A      | Y         |

**Issue**: Combining multiple relationships (Supplier-Part and Part-Project) creates redundancy.
