# Excluding files from repository

  Reference: [http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore](http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore)
To exclude certains directories and files you need to place them in ```.gitignore``` file. Here you can find some examples for popular project structures: [https://github.com/github/gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore)

The purpose of gitignore files is to ensure that certain files not tracked by Git remain untracked.
To ignore uncommitted changes in a file that is already tracked, use ```git update-index --assume-unchanged```.
To stop tracking a file that is currently tracked, use ```git rm --cached```.

# Push to all git remotes with the one command

Create an all remote with several repo URLs to its name:

```
git remote add all [url1]
git remote set-url --add all [url2]
git remote set-url --add all [url3]
```

Then just `git push all --all`.

This is how it looks in .git/config:

```
  [remote "all"]
  url = [url1]
  url = [url2]
  url = [url3]
```

# Branching

 * ```git branch -a``` - display branches
 * ```git branch --merged``` - display only merged branches
 * ```git branch --no-merged``` - display only no merged branches
 * ```git branch -df <branchName>``` - force to delete branch locally
 * ```git push origin --delete <branchName>``` - deletes branch remotelly
 * ```git pull -a --prune``` - prunes all local branches

# Patching

* ```git format-patch -2 HEAD``` - create patch out of 2 previous commits to autogenerated file
* ```git format-patch -2 HEAD --stdout > fix.patch``` - create patch out of 2 previous commits to file ```fix.patch```
* ```git apply --stat fix.patch ``` displays stats about patch
* ```git apply --check fix.patch ```checks patch if possible to apply
* ```git apply fix.patch ``` - applies patch

# Reverting changes
* ```git reset --soft HEAD^``` - uncommiting latest commit and make all changes unstaged. It works when the commit is not pushed to upstream

# Certificates

## Generate private / public keys

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```

To use ssh with remote repositories you need to publish your public key to this services. It can be localized here:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Go to: https://github.com/settings/keys and add the above content.
Test connectivity:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```
