# Section 1: Designing and planning a cloud solution architecture

## 1.1.	Designing a solution infrastructure that meets business requirements. Considerations include:

* business use cases and product strategy
* cost optimization
* supporting the application design
* integration
* movement of data
* tradeoffs
* build, buy or modify
* success measurements (e.g., Key Performance Indicators (KPI), Return on Investment (ROI), metrics)

## 1.2	Designing a solution infrastructure that meets technical requirements. Considerations include:
* high availability and failover design
* elasticity of cloud resources
* scalability to meet growth requirements

## 1.3	Designing network, storage, and compute resources. Considerations include:
* integration with on premises/multi-cloud environments
* identification of data storage needs and mapping to storage systems
* data flow diagrams
* storage system structure (e.g., Object, File, RDBMS, NoSQL, New SQL)
* mapping compute needs to platform products

## 1.4	Creating a migration plan (i.e., documents and architectural diagrams). Considerations include:
* integrating solution with existing systems
* migrating systems and data to support the solution
* licensing mapping
* network and management planning
* testing and proof-of-concept

## 1.5	Envisioning future solution improvements. Considerations include:
* cloud and technology improvements
* business needs evolution
* evangelism and advocacy

# Section 2: Managing and provisioning solution Infrastructure

## 2.1	Configuring network topologies. Considerations include:

* extending to on-premises (hybrid networking)
* extending to a multi-cloud environment
* security
* data protection

## 2.2	Configuring individual storage systems. Considerations include:

* data storage allocation
* data processing/compute provisioning
* security and access management
* network configuration for data transfer and latency
* data retention and data lifecycle management
* data growth management

## 2.3	Configuring compute systems. Considerations include:

* compute system provisioning
* compute volatility configuration (preemptible vs. standard)
* network configuration for compute nodes
* orchestration technology configuration (e.g. Chef/Puppet/Kubernetes)

# Section 3: Designing for security and compliance

## 3.1	Designing for security. Considerations include:

* Identity and Access Management (IAM)
* data security
* penetration testing
* Separation of Duties (SoD)
* security controls

## 3.2	Designing for legal compliance. Considerations include:

* legislation (e.g., Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Childrenâ€™s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), etc.)
* audits
* certification (e.g., Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) framework)

# Section 4: Analyzing and optimizing technical and business processes

## 4.1	Analyzing and defining technical processes. Considerations include:

* Software Development Lifecycle Plan (SDLC)
* continuous integration / continuous deployment
* troubleshooting / post mortem analysis culture
* testing and validation
* IT enterprise process (e.g. ITIL)
* business continuity and disaster recovery

## 4.2	Analyzing and defining business processes. Considerations include:

* stakeholder management (e.g. Influencing and facilitation)
* change management
* decision making process
* customer success management

## 4.3	Developing procedures to test resilience of solution in production (e.g., DiRT and Chaos Monkey)

# Section 5: Managing implementation

## 5.1	Advising development/operation team(s) to ensure successful deployment of the solution. Considerations include:

* application development
* API best practices
* testing frameworks (load/unit/integration)
* data and system migration tooling

## 5.2	Reading and writing application development languages. At a minimum, languages include:

* Java
* Python

# Section 6: Ensuring solution and operations reliability

## 6.1 Monitoring/Logging/Alerting solution
## 6.2 Deployment and release management
## 6.3	Supporting operational troubleshooting
## 6.4	Evaluating quality control measures
